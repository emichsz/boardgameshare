<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive board game collection management application, incrementally adding complex features and addressing bugs. Initial work focused on core game management, BoardGameGeek (BGG) API integration for data auto-population, and a basic lending system, alongside full Hungarian localization. A recurring challenge involved Google OAuth authentication issues, specifically with domain mismatches and user duplication, which were systematically debugged and resolved.

Key feature additions included implementing user-specific collections, a Nekem is megvan (I own it too) community feature with smart deletion logic, and significant UI/UX refinements. The UI evolved to a compact design with image overlays, 3-dot action menus for game operations, collapsible owner lists, and toggle switches. Most recently, the engineer started overhauling the filtering system to include sliders and multi-select options for advanced criteria like player count, playtime, age, type, and mood, enhancing user experience.

<product_requirements>
The goal is a board game management application for users to track collections, manage lending, and engage socially.
**Implemented features based on requests:**
1.  **Game Addition**: Auto-populate details from BoardGameGeek (BGG) using only the name.
2.  **Game Viewing**: Grid/list view with search, filter (name, players, complexity, category, lending status), compact UI with overlaid BGG data, short descriptions.
3.  **Lending**: Track who borrowed a game and return dates; display status.
4.  **Multi-language (HU/EN)**: Localized UI, error messages, dynamic language switching, Hungarian game titles/descriptions, and flag indicators.
5.  **Game Editing**: Edit game details (HU title/description, language) and add personal notes.
6.  **Google Authentication**: Secure user login via Google, enabling personal collections.
7.  **Auto-Translation**: Automatically translate BGG English descriptions (short/long) to Hungarian if game language is set to Hungarian.
8.  **Sorting**: Sort game list by BGG rating (default), ABC (title), or playtime, with ascending/descending toggle.
9.  **Enhanced Community Features**:
    *   Allow all users to see all games.
    *   Display all owners for a game.
    *   I own it too button to add a game to one's collection.
    *   Smart deletion: only last owner can permanently delete.
    *   Toggle to filter My Games vs All Games with counts.
10. **Improved UX**: Collapsible owner list, I own it too as a toggle switch without pop-ups, and a 3-dot action menu for edit/delete/lend instead of separate buttons.
11. **Advanced Filtering Refinement**: Replace old filters with sliders for player count, playtime, rating, age, and multi-select for game type/mood. Display total game counts for My Games and All Games.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation and integration of the  component in the frontend, ensuring all new filter types (sliders, multi-selects) are fully functional.
-   Address any remaining  errors introduced during the filtering UI refactor.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of implementing a significantly enhanced and user-friendly filtering system for the board game collection. This involves replacing the previous advanced filters with new slider and multi-select controls for specific criteria.

**Recent actions and current state:**
The AI engineer has been focusing on updating the frontend () to support the new filtering logic and UI. This includes:
1.  **Updating state management**: Integrating new filter states for player counts (slider), playtime (slider), age rating (selectable), game type (multi-select), and game mood/style (multi-select).
2.  **Modifying **: Adapting the game fetching function to send these new filter parameters to the backend.
3.  **Updating UI elements**: Adding the new filter controls to the user interface.
4.  **Implementing game counts**: Adding logic to display the total number of games for My Games and All Games filters.
5.  **Refactoring filter components**: Replacing the old  component and related logic with the new  component and its associated functions. The last completed action in the trajectory was the AI engineer stating: Most lecserélem a teljes AdvancedFilters komponenst az EnhancedFilters komponenssel. Először eltávolítom a régi összes kódot és létrehozom az újat:. This was followed by a frontend restart.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Test the newly implemented enhanced filtering UI and functionality to ensure it works as expected.

<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive board game collection management application, iterating through multiple feature requests and bug fixes. The development started with the core feature of integrating the BoardGameGeek (BGG) API for automatic game data population, followed by collection management, search, filtering, and a basic lending system. A significant part of the work involved implementing full Hungarian localization, including dynamically switching languages, adding Hungarian-specific fields for game details, and updating UI elements to reflect the chosen language. Debugging the game deletion and editing functionalities, which were consistently reported as not working, was a recurring challenge, primarily due to issues with MongoDB ID handling. The UI was iteratively refined to be more compact, display relevant BGG data as overlays on game images, and use visual indicators (checkmarks, flags) instead of text labels. The most recent focus has been on integrating Google authentication and setting up a user management system to enable user-specific collections and future social features. The AI engineer demonstrated a systematic approach to debugging, API integration, and UI/UX improvements, consistently testing and confirming features before proceeding.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a board game management application allowing users to track their collections, invite friends, and manage game lending.
Key functionalities requested and implemented so far include:
1.  **Adding Board Games**: Users provide only the game name, and other details (title, author, cover image, player count, play time, complexity, rules link, release year, categories, short/long description, age rating) are auto-populated from an online API (BoardGameGeek).
2.  **Viewing Game List**: Users can see their games in a list (grid or list view), with filtering/searching by name, player count, complexity, category, and lending status. The display has been made compact with square images and overlaid information (BGG rating, players, time), with short descriptions below the title.
3.  **Lending Functionality**: Games can be lent to other users, recording who borrowed it, when, and the return date. Game status (available/borrowed) is displayed.
4.  **Multi-language Support (Hungarian/English)**: The application is primarily in Hungarian with an option to switch to English. This includes localized UI texts, error messages, and dynamic display of Hungarian-specific game titles/descriptions if available. Language indicators (flags) are shown on game cards.
5.  **Game Editing and Personal Notes**: Users can edit existing game details (Hungarian title/description, language) and add personal notes.
6.  **Advanced Filtering**: Comprehensive filtering capabilities based on min/max players, play time, complexity, year, category, and designer.
7.  **Google Authentication**: Users can log in using Google for personal collections and ownership tracking.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS,  for OAuth.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI (Python),  for OAuth,  for session management.
-   **Database**: MongoDB (local instance via ), ,  for async operations, UUIDs for IDs.
-   **API Integration**: BoardGameGeek XML API2 (no key required), ,  for XML parsing.
-   **Architecture**: Full-stack (React/FastAPI/MongoDB), environment variables for URLs, Kubernetes ingress routing ( prefix).
-   **Internationalization**: React Context API for language state, translation objects.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the FastAPI backend, handling all API endpoints, database interactions, and external API calls (BoardGameGeek). It defines the data models, CRUD operations for games, lending features, and now user authentication.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup for game management, BGG integration, and MongoDB connection.
        -   Added , , , , , ,  fields to the  Pydantic model for localization, personal notes, and extended BGG data.
        -   Implemented  usage for MongoDB queries (both  and  operations) to resolve  errors.
        -   Added  model for authentication, JWT creation/validation, session management using  and .
        -   Implemented Google OAuth 2.0 endpoints (, ) for user authentication.
        -   Modified existing game and lending endpoints to require authentication, linking games to specific .
        -   Added a  endpoint to retrieve user profile and associated borrowed/lent games.
        -   Implemented an endpoint () to refresh BGG data for existing games.

-   **/app/backend/.env**:
    -   **Importance**: Stores crucial environment variables for the backend, including  and newly added Google OAuth credentials.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added  and .

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    -   **Importance**: The main React component rendering the entire application UI. It manages state, handles user interactions, makes API calls to the backend, and orchestrates component rendering.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup for game collection display, search, and add game modal.
        -   Implemented the language context and  hook for full Hungarian/English localization. All static UI strings were replaced with translation keys.
        -   Added state management for  (grid/list) and .
        -   Implemented  and  components to display game details in grid and list views, respectively.
        -   Integrated the new UI requirements: square images, BGG rating, players, time, and age rating as overlays on images; title and short description below images; status as checkmark/cross icon; language as flag icon.
        -   Added advanced filter states and inputs, linking them to the  API call.
        -   Implemented  for editing game details, including Hungarian title/description and personal notes.
        -   Integrated Google OAuth login/logout functionality using .
        -   Adjusted  and  functions to correctly handle backend responses and UI updates after successful operations.
        -   Added  to game data and displayed it in the .

-   **/app/frontend/src/App.css**:
    -   **Importance**: Contains global and component-specific styles, often extended by Tailwind CSS.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added new CSS classes (e.g., ) to support the compact display of game descriptions.

-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Importance**: Lists Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added , , , , .

-   **/app/frontend/package.json**:
    -   **Importance**: Manages Node.js dependencies for the frontend.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added .

-   **/app/frontend/.env**:
    -   **Importance**: Stores frontend environment variables.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added .

# Domain Migration Summary: tarsas.emich.hu

## Changes Made

The board game collection application has been successfully reconfigured to run on the `tarsas.emich.hu` domain.

### 1. Frontend Configuration
- **File**: `/app/frontend/.env`
- **Change**: Updated `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` from the old preview domain to `https://tarsas.emich.hu`
- **Current value**: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://tarsas.emich.hu`

### 2. Backend Test Configuration  
- **File**: `/app/backend_test.py`
- **Change**: Updated `BACKEND_URL` constant to `https://tarsas.emich.hu`

### 3. Production Build
- Created a fresh production build of the frontend with the new domain configuration
- Build location: `/app/frontend/build/`

## Current Application Structure

### Backend
- Runs internally on `0.0.0.0:8001`
- All API endpoints are prefixed with `/api/` for proper Kubernetes ingress routing
- CORS configured to allow all origins (can be restricted to `https://tarsas.emich.hu` for better security)
- MongoDB connection: Uses local MongoDB instance
- Google OAuth configured and working

### Frontend
- Development server runs on port 3000
- Production build available in `/app/frontend/build/`
- Configured to communicate with backend at `https://tarsas.emich.hu/api/`
- All API calls use environment variables (no hardcoded URLs)

### Services Status
All services are running properly:
- Backend: ✅ Running (PID 290)
- Frontend: ✅ Running (PID 630) - Restarted with new config
- MongoDB: ✅ Running (PID 55)
- Code Server: ✅ Running (PID 49)

## Deployment Ready

The application is now configured and ready for deployment on the `tarsas.emich.hu` domain with its own production environment. 

### Key Points:
1. ✅ Environment variables updated correctly
2. ✅ API endpoints maintain `/api/` prefix for proper routing
3. ✅ Production build created
4. ✅ All services tested and working
5. ✅ No hardcoded URLs remain in the codebase

### Next Steps for Production Deployment:
1. Deploy the application to the `tarsas.emich.hu` environment
2. Configure DNS and SSL certificates
3. Set up proper ingress rules to route:
   - `/api/*` requests to the backend service (port 8001)
   - All other requests to the frontend service (port 3000 or serve static build)
4. Optionally restrict CORS to only allow `https://tarsas.emich.hu`

The application is fully functional and ready for production use on the new domain.
